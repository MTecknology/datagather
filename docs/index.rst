Inspired by a terrible set of scripts which never worked correcly, this is yet
another collection of scripts used to simplify monitoring of random endpoints.

Installation:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install datagather

Usage:

.. code-block:: shell

    python -m datagather -h
    # OR
    datagather -h
